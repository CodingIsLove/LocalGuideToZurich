# ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ Locals guide to ZÃ¼rich - Welcome to my City 
Hey there ðŸ‘‹. My Name is Chris, I was born and raised in ZÃ¼rich Switzerland and love to show what ZÃ¼rich has to offer
to all my foreign friends. Since I had to write a list each time, I wanted to show the city to someone new, I thought
, that it could be a good idea, to just share my list directly on Github ðŸ™ˆ. You will find here all the things I love 
about my city (it's completely biased by my personal opinion, but I hope you like it). Feel free to share this repo with
your friends and send me some pull requests, if you have some further tipps about what to do in ZÃ¼rich.
